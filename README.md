# Book Search Engine

## Description
For this project I was provided a fully functional RESTful API, and had to refactor it into a GraphQL API.

The app allows users to search for books by keyword. Registered users can also save books to their accounts, or delete saved books from their accounts.


## User Story

```
AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```

## Mock-Up


Let's start by revisiting the web application's appearance and functionality.

As you can see in the following animation, a user can type a search term (in this case, "star wars") in a search box and the results appear:

![Animation shows "star wars" typed into a search box and books about Star Wars appearing as results.]![21-mern-homework-demo-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87583026/150700636-76ad4a73-e38e-4532-9737-4c009caa37b7.gif)
The user can save books by clicking "Save This Book!" under each search result, as shown in the following animation:

![Animation shows user clicking "Save This Book!" button to save books that appear in search results. The button label changes to "Book Already Saved" after it is clicked and the book is saved.]![21-mern-homework-demo-02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87583026/150700656-e163facc-85e1-4daf-9939-58f50e933e87.gif)

A user can view their saved books on a separate page, as shown in the following animation:
